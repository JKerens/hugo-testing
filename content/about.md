I am a husband, father, and technologist. I have been in technology for over 15 years working on everything from IT, SQL, security, to development. My passion is in learning new technology and sharing it with people. Currently, I work as the manager of DevOps at a company called HCSS and I am on the tech leads team for consulting the company on architectural design. This blog is just to collect all my ideas into one place and hopefully make it easier to share with the world. If I'm lucky enough, hopefully this will reach at least one person and make a difference.
